# Pendrive-Copy
This repository contains an .exe in folder and code to automatically copy all the contents of pen-drive and store it in "D:\Contents" folder.The folder "Contents" will be createdin D drive automtically .

This was developed because I felt it was quite mundane task to copy contents from pen-drive many times.(I felt this because I didn't have hard-disk and I wanted to transfer many movies and Tv series from others to my laptop.
Just insert pen-drive and click OK to transfer.

The code is in python.I have py2exe to generate .exe file.

Improvements to be done:
->Make it a background process
->Folder name should be user dependent.(Should not have conflict with folder name" Contents")/
->Partial copy should be done.
